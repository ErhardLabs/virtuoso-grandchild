# Virtuoso Grandchild - Child theme customization plugin

Useful if you want to make project specific style changes/overrides to your virtuoso theme but not change any core virtuoso files 

## Dependencies

This plugin is dependent upon the following:

1. [virtuoso child theme](https://github.com/ErhardLabs/virtuoso)

## Instructions to install:

1. Open up terminal and navigate to the `plugins` folder.
2. Then type: `git clone https://github.com/ErhardLabs/virtuoso-grandchild.git`
3. Navigate into the new folder `virtuoso-grandchild`
4. Compile your assets in the virtuoso theme

## Sass Files

To make styling changes, navigate to `assets/sass`.  There you will find each of the partial files which contain the CSS styling.

Changes to the styles in the grandchild plugin will override theme styles. No need to use `!important` tags
